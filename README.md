# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Foundations course.<br>
It aims to replicate an "Etch-a-Sketch" toy where users can draw on a grid with their mouse, changing the color of grid squares as they hover over them.<br>
The project focuses on JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and CSS layout using Flexbox.

## Demo

Check out the live version of the project: [Demo Link](https://b0llull0s.github.io/Project-Etch-a-Sketch/)  

## Features

- **16x16 Grid**: A 16x16 grid of square divs is generated on page load.
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Users can change the grid size up to 100x100 squares by clicking the **Reset** button and entering a new size.
- **Mouse Hover Effect**: The grid squares change color when the mouse hovers over them, simulating drawing.
- **Random Colors & Darkening**: Each square gets a random color when hovered, and with each pass of the mouse, the color progressively darkens until fully black.
- **Grid Border Toggle**: A checkbox allows users to enable or disable the borders around each grid square for a cleaner or more structured look.

## How to Use

1. Hover over the grid to start drawing.
2. Click the **Reset** button to generate a new grid size (up to 100x100).
3. Use the **Show Grid Borders** checkbox to show or hide the borders between squares.
